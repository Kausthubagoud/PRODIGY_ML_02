# Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering

This project implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The dataset used for this project is the Mall Customers dataset, containing information about customers' annual income and spending score.

## Files

- `customer_purchase_history.csv`: Dataset containing customer purchase history.
- `kmeans_clustering.py`: Python script for K-means clustering algorithm.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `kmeans_clustering.py` script to perform K-means clustering and visualize customer segmentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Credits
